unoptimized\23.txt,optimized\23.txt,O(n^2),O(n),java,The optimized version uses a stream to collect language codes directly from the product descriptions.
unoptimized\24.txt,optimized\24.txt,O(n^2),O(n),java,The optimized version eliminates the unnecessary nested loops and directly adds the variant codes to the map.
unoptimized\25.txt,optimized\25.txt,O(n),O(n),java,"Optimized code multiplies the price by the quantity directly, reducing the number of operations significantly."
unoptimized\26.txt,optimized\26.txt,O(n^2),O(n),java,The optimized version uses a single loop with a set containment check.
unoptimized\27.txt,optimized\27.txt,O(n^2),O(n),java,The optimized version simplifies this to O(n) by using a single loop and a map to efficiently check for duplicates and update quantities.
